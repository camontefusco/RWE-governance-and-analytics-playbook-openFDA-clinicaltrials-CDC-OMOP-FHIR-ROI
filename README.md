# RWE-governance-and-analytics-playbook-openFDA-clinicaltrials-CDC-OMOP-FHIR-ROI
A comprehensive playbook combining governance frameworks, analytics methodologies, interoperability standards (OMOP/FHIR), and real-world data sources (OpenFDA, ClinicalTrials.gov, CDC) with ROI modeling.

**Focus:** Enterprise governance, interoperability, and strategic enablement for **Real-World Evidence (RWE)**

---

## 🌍 Why this matters

Pharma and biotech companies face growing demand to deliver **trustworthy, reproducible evidence** from **Real-World Data (RWD)**.  
Regulators and payers are scrutinizing **governance, interoperability, and bias mitigation** while business leaders want to see **time-to-value and ROI**.

This repository is a **leadership-oriented playbook** to show how to move from **data → evidence → impact**, using public datasets and practical scorecards.

## 📂 What’s inside

### 1) Governance & Enablement
- `templates/rwe_governance_checklist.md` – Intake + stage-gate checklist across purpose, rights/ethics, quality, standards, methods, GxP, and communication.  
- `templates/data_stewardship_policy.md` – One-pager with roles, minimum controls, and audit readiness.  

### 2) Real-World Data Demos (notebooks/)
- **`01_openfda_governance_scorecard.ipynb`** → Governance metrics on **OpenFDA** adverse event reports (completeness, timeliness, conformity).  
- **`02_ctgov_portfolio_and_roi.ipynb`** → Portfolio context from **ClinicalTrials.gov** (statuses, durations, enrollment) feeding into ROI scenarios.  
- **`03_cdc_public_health_signals.ipynb`** → **CDC** surveillance data used for timeliness/completeness checks and feasibility signals.  
- **`04_omop_fhir_conformity_checks.ipynb`** → Adds **OMOP/FHIR/vocabulary** conformity plus CT.gov & CDC context → expanded scorecard with a **Context** component.  

### 3) ROI Lens (scripts/ + Streamlit)
- `scripts/roi.py` – Simple, explainable ROI model (cost savings, time benefit, regulatory acceptance uplift).  
- `streamlit_app.py` – Interactive app to communicate value with stakeholders.

## 🚀 Quick start

```bash
# install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# run a notebook (e.g., governance scorecard)
jupyter notebook notebooks/01_openfda_governance_scorecard.ipynb

# launch ROI lens app
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
## 🧭 Talking points for leadership

- **From governance to value** → Data quality and provenance drive evidentiary readiness; the ROI lens translates readiness into time, cost, and success outcomes.  
- **Interoperability at scale** → Scorecard includes OMOP/FHIR/vocabulary conformity, anticipating regulatory expectations for standardized RWE.  
- **Bias-aware by design** → Checklists formalize confounding strategies, sensitivity analyses, and negative controls.  
- **Enablement & adoption** → Templates and an app lower the barrier for clinical, regulatory, HEOR, and market access teams.  

---

## 📊 Roadmap

- Add **OMOP/FHIR conformity automation** using public CDM/FHIR test datasets.  
- Extend **jurisdictional privacy** checks (GDPR, HIPAA, DUA) in the governance workflow.  
- Build **portfolio dashboards** in Streamlit to compare sources, geographies, and therapies.  
- Integrate **payer evidence heuristics** (cost offsets, budget impact) into ROI modeling.
