# Global RWE Governance & Conformity Report
_Generated: 2025-09-05 14:57_
## Overview
This report summarizes data governance and interoperability readiness across multiple RWE sources. Scores combine completeness, consistency, timeliness, conformity, and standards (OMOP/FHIR).
## Methods (what we did)
- Governance metrics: non-null completeness in key fields, schema stability, data timeliness (last 14 days), conformity checks.
- Standards metric: average of OMOP vocabulary signals (e.g., MedDRA/RxNorm/ICD/LOINC presence) and FHIR resource shape.
- Sources used: OpenFDA (AdverseEvent), ClinicalTrials.gov (ResearchStudy), CDC (Observation-like).
- Heuristics: column/value pattern checks for vocab signals; required elements for FHIR structure.
- Artifacts: consolidated table and (if available) plots.

## Results (scores and metrics)
| Source | N | Completeness | Consistency | Timeliness | Conformity | Standards | Omop Vocab | Fhir Struct | Overall Score |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| OPENFDA | 499.00 | 0.98 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.85 |
| CTGOV | 400.00 | 0.92 | 1.00 | 0.01 | 1.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.63 |
| CDC | 1404.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 0.12 | 1.00 | 0.50 | 0.00 | 1.00 | 0.75 |

## OMOP / FHIR Conformity Signals
- OPENFDA: OMOP 0.77 | FHIR 1.00 | Signals: MedDRA:Y | ISO:0.9 | RxNorm-ish:0.0 | FHIR:id,date,serious
- CTGOV: OMOP 0.30 | FHIR 1.00 | Signals: ICD10-in-Cond:0.0 | FHIR:NCTId,OverallStatus,Phase,Dates
- CDC: OMOP 0.00 | FHIR 1.00 | Signals: FHIR:date,geo,numeric

## Recommendations (by source)
### OPENFDA
- Strengthen standards: map drugs/conditions to OMOP vocabularies (RxNorm/SNOMED/ICD/LOINC).
- Complete FHIR resource shape: ensure required elements for AdverseEvent / ResearchStudy / Observation.
### CTGOV
- Improve timeliness: reduce data latency (ingestion cadence, ETL scheduling, use incremental endpoints).
- Strengthen standards: map drugs/conditions to OMOP vocabularies (RxNorm/SNOMED/ICD/LOINC).
- Complete FHIR resource shape: ensure required elements for AdverseEvent / ResearchStudy / Observation.
### CDC
- Improve timeliness: reduce data latency (ingestion cadence, ETL scheduling, use incremental endpoints).
- Strengthen standards: map drugs/conditions to OMOP vocabularies (RxNorm/SNOMED/ICD/LOINC).

## Next Actions (portfolio-level)
- Add RxNorm mapping (via RxNav) to lift OpenFDA OMOP vocabulary score.
- Enrich ClinicalTrials.gov conditions with MeSH/UMLS to improve vocabulary linkage.
- Automate CDC geo/date detection in Notebook 03 save step to guarantee FHIR completeness.
- Integrate negative controls/sensitivity analyses into a standard RWE methods checklist.
- Publish the governance scorecard JSON and a 1-page explainer to stakeholders per release.

## How to Interpret and Use These RWE Results
- Regulatory: Map outcomes/exposures to standard vocabularies; ensure FHIR resource completeness.
- Payer/HEOR: Connect governance gains to ROI (faster cycles, clearer value).
- Clinical: Use safety/population signals to prioritize trials and refine designs.
- Data Ops: Monitor governance trends and alert on thresholds.
- Attach this report and JSON scorecard to milestone reviews.
